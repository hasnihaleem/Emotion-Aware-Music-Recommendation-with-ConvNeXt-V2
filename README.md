# Emotion-Aware-Music-Recommendation-with-ConvNeXt-V2
My final year project, an Emotion-Aware Music Recommender, uses ConvNeXt V2 to bridge human affect and digital media. By analyzing real-time facial expressions, it bypasses static history to provide music matching a user's psychological state. Developed with PyTorch and Spotify API, it showcases expertise in CV, DL, and system integration.
